# PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary dataframe that displays data by different city types while extracting the data from the csv files. Utilizing Python/Pandas skills and knowledge we also created a multiple-line chart that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
## Overview of Analysis
1. A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
2. A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
3. A written report for the PyBer analysis [README.md]
## Results
- Urban cities had the highest results in the amount of total rides, drivers, and fares
- Rural cities had the lowest results in the amount of total rides, drivers, and fares
- Urban cities had the highest results, they had a lower average fare per ride and driver
- Rural cities had the lowest results, yet they had a higher average fare per ride and diver

## Summary
With all the collected data we can conclude that a rural city will demand a higher fare rate due to smaller demographic of customers in this area. Also the distance between destinations and time is most likely longer resulting in highger average fare per ride & driver tcompared to the other city types. Vice versa for Urban cities with theses concluded results. What we could recommend for all cities is to increase fares based on how busy traffic is "rush hour". Also include a increase a fee based on the amount of riders are on per driver. With this Rural and Urban cities will have a little bit more positive similar results, better price of fares, and satisfied customers & drivers.
