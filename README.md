# PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary dataframe that displays data by different city types while extracting the data from the csv files. Utilizing Python/Pandas skills and knowledge we also created a multiple-line chart that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
## Overview of Analysis
1. A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
2. A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
3. A written report for the PyBer analysis [README.md]
## Results
- Urban cities had the highest results in the amount of total rides, drivers, and fares
- Rural cities had the lowest results in the amount of total rides, drivers, and fares
- Urban cities had the highest results, they had a lower average fare per ride and driver
- Rural cities had the lowest results, yet they had a higher average fare per ride and diver
